### 💡 How to use:
1. Open your Bash terminal inside the project folder.  
2. Copy-paste the above code and press **Enter**.  
3. It will create and save a `README.md` file with all the content inside.  

Would you like me to tailor this README slightly depending on whether your StayHealthy project is **pure front-end** (HTML/CSS/JS) or a **full-stack (React + Node)** version?
